Overview
--------
PlayMeBuilder try to solve the boring task to create PlayMe API clients 
for multiple programming languages and platforms.
The user specifies an XML specification file which describes the PlayMe API,
(don't worry it is included in the repository) and the library do the magic 
using a set of predefined skeleton templates.

The official API can be found at http://lab.playme.com.


Getting Started
---------------
You can download and install PlayMeBuilder releases using 
'pip install PlayMeBuilder' or 'easy_install PlayMeBuilder'.

You can get the development version from Git repository on github,
then run "python setup.py install".

In both cases at the end of installation process you can run a script
named 'playme-builder':

    $ playme-builder -h
    Usage: playme-builder build [-l LANGUAGE -f FILE -d DESTINATION]

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit.

      -f FILE, --file=FILE  FILE contains XML specifications of the API.

      -l LANGUAGE, --language=LANGUAGE
                            LANGUAGE specifies the programming language in which
                            the API will be implemented (i.e. Python).

      -d DESTINATION, --destination=DESTINATION
                            DESTINATION specifies the folder in which the API
                            clients will be saved.

If you run without options:

    $ playme-builder
    $ playme-builder build

the script use the internal XML schema to build an API client 
for each supported language, it saves them in the home folder of the user.
